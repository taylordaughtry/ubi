## Contributing

I welcome all pull requests, and would be glad to chat about specific questions and comments you might have. There are, however, two standards in place:

1. The `.editorconfig` file in the repository should be enabled for your editor.
2. All files enforce a PSR2 standard.

## Ubi Development
This project is under active development, and shouldn't be relied upon in an enterprise situation just yet. That said, I'll document all breaking changes, and semantic versioning is being enforced in this project.
